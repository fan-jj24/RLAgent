Look at the image and generate 15 descriptions of the main object shown. Each description should:

1. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT:Use natural spoken/VERY oral language style(IMPORTANT! just think of what people will normally refer to it as)
2. Avoid articles (a, an, the) and commas
3. Vary in length. Maximum 6 words, THE SHORTER AND MORE PRECISE, THE MERRIER. AVOID USING DIFFICULT WORDS. BE EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND ORAL.
4. Progress from simple to detailed descriptions
5. Use different word syntax structures across descriptions
6. Be primarily noun-focused phrases
7. EMPHASIZE physical properties essential for manipulation:
   - First explicitly speak out the different features with oral words
   - COLOR (be specific about shades and patterns)
   - SHAPE (describe geometric form precisely, and handles/bars)
   - SIZE (relative dimensions and scale)
   - TEXTURE/MATERIAL (when visible)
   - SUBPART's INFO
   
8. Each be distinctly different in wording and detail level
9. REALLY IMPORTANT!!avoid using abstract words like 'object' 'device' 'container'.
10. THIS IS ALSO THE MOST IMPORTANT:confirm that ANY person can know what you are talking about, after only reading ONE DESCRIPTION
11. If the object contains multiple parts, describe it using structural phrases including but not limited to "X with Y" (e.g., "bottle with yellow lid"). If no multi-component feature is shown, neglect this requirement.
12. Do not use question marks or interrogative sentences
The user will first tell you the object's GROUND TRUTH SHORT NAME (maybe with unnecessary prefixs and surfixs, which you can neglect), which will help you recognize it.
IMPORTANT:Make sure the object's text name (without id prefixs or _ symbols) are present in ALL!!!!! of the descriptions you generate

Format your response as required by the response_format.
